Shaman
======
Originally inspired by `weatherman <http://darkhorse.nu/weatherman/>`_, ``shaman`` is a small command-line application written in C for fetching current weather conditions from the `NOAA <http://forecast.weather.gov>`_.

For those who aren't familiar with the concept of a forecast stone, think of it like this. This software's most basic function is, essentially, a digital form of this:

Status & Documentation
----------------------
``shaman`` has grown in functionality a great deal, and to get a good idea of where the program stands, please see the documentation (``man shaman``).

To-Do
-----
#. Allow specifying a location by "City, ST" and not just through a zipcode
#. Add 7-day forecasts

Possible Features
-----------------
The following list includes things that I am contemplating including but due to the great increase of code they may require, they may never see the light of day. If they are to bear fruit, it will certainly not be before the To-Do list is complete as they are planned features working toward a "stable" release.

* Switch to a format code printing system
