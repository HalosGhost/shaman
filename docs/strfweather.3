.SH NAME

strfweather
\- fetch weather data in native C 
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <weather.h> 
.PP
size_t strfweather (char * dest_str, size_t max, const char * format, const struct weather * weather); 
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

The strfweather
function breaks down the weather struct according to the passed format and writes the result to dest_str to, at most, max bytes. 
.PP
The format specification is a null\-terminated char array (a string) which consists of any number of conversion specifiers (each beginning with a %) and normal text. 
Any non\-conversion specifier character will be copied verbatim to dest_str (including the null byte). 
Conversion specifiers, however, will be replaced with the unit they represent. 
A list of conversion specifiers and their results are below. 
.PP
.SH FORMAT

The following format specifiers are permitted: 
.PP
.Vb
%%    A literal percent sign
%a    Time of data receipt       (unixtime)
%b    Barometric pressure        (hectoPascals)
%c    Weather condition string
%C    Weather condition code
%d    Cloud coverage             (percent)
%h    Low temperature            (°F | °C)
%H    High temperature           (°F | °C)
%i    City ID number
%I    City name
%j    Country Code
%l    Latitude                   (degrees)
%L    Longitude                  (degrees)
%p    Precipitation              (in | mm)
%P    Relative humidity          (percent)
%s    Time of sunrise            (unixtime)
%S    Time of sunset             (unixtime)
%t    Current temperature        (°F | °C)
%w    Sustained wind speed       (mph|kmph)
%W    Gusting wind speed         (mph|kmph)
%x    Wind heading               (degrees)
%X    Wind heading               (Cardinal / Ordinal direction)
.Ve
.PP
Since all non\-conversion specifiers are copied verbatim, escape sequences (e.g., \\n and \\r) are allowed. 
If the format specification calls for a string in the weather struct that is null, strfweather
will write the string "Unavailable" in its place. 
.PP
.SH RETURN VALUE

Should the whole string be copied to dest_str without truncating, strfweather
will return the number of bytes written (the length of dest_str). 
If, however, the output to dest_str should be truncated, strfweather
will return 0.
