.SH NAME

Shaman
\- A lightweight tool to fetch weather data 
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS

shaman
[\fBoptions\fP]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

Shaman
is a very lightweight application to fetch weather data. 
.PP
If shaman
is not given a location, it will take the data from the cache file. 
If shaman
is not given a format string, it will default to "%c (%t°U)" (where "U" is either "F" or "C" depending on the units requested). 
.PP
.SH CACHING AND REFRESHING

Shaman
will look for the cache in the following locations stopping upon the first file found:
.br
.PP
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shaman/cache.json
.br
$HOME/.shaman/cache.json
.PP
In accordance with OpenWeatherMap\&'s API, a call for new data should be made no more often than once per 10 minutes per device. 
Shaman
will, therefore, automatically use data from the cache (assuming the requested location is the same) until the file\&'s last\-modified timestamp is over 10 minutes old (or the \fB\-\-refresh\fP
flag has been passed).
